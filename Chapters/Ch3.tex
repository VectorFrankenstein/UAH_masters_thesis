\chapter{Chapter 3. Research Questions}

Working under the hypothesis that similar genomic factors be associated with both a reduction in chromosome number and the evolution of heterosporous lineages, I will explore the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Have any gene families undergone a significant contraction or expansion in copy number on lineages leading to heterosporous clades? If so, is there anything about putative gene function that provides a clue to the association of heterospory and chromosome number?
	\item Have any gene families undergone distinct and parallel patterns of selection on lineages leading to heterosporous clades?  If so, is there anything about putative gene function that provides a clue to the association of heterospory and chromosome number?
\end{itemize}

Exploration and comparison of genomic factors that underlie evolutionarily related heterosporous and homosporous lineages could be a source of novel phylogenetic insight into a possible association between the disparate traits of chromosome number and spore production.
