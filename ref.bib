  abstract  = "All sexually reproducing eukaryotes have a life cycle consisting
               of a haploid and a diploid phase, marked by meiosis and syngamy
               (fertilization). Each phase is adapted to certain environmental
               conditions. In land plants, the recently reconstructed phylogeny
               indicates that the life cycle has evolved from a condition with
               a dominant free-living haploid gametophyte to one with a
               dominant free-living diploid sporophyte. The latter condition
               allows plants to produce more genotypic diversity by harnessing
               the diversity-generating power of meiosis and fertilization, and
               is selectively favored as more solar energy is fixed and fed
               into the biosystem on earth and the environment becomes more
               heterogeneous entropically. Liverworts occupy an important
               position for understanding the origin of the diploid generation
               in the life cycle of land plants. Hornworts and lycophytes
               represent critical extant transitional groups in the change from
               the gametophyte to the sporophyte as the independent free-living
               generation. Seed plants, with the most elaborate sporophyte and
               the most reduced gametophyte (except the megagametophyte in many
               gymnosperms), have the best developed sexual reproduction system

              reconstruct the ancestral chromosome number of the common

              over 5000 taxa. Our analyses revealed an ancestral haploid

              from molecular data. A substantial body of work has focused on
              developing a class of ``branch-site'' models which permit
              selective pressures on sequences, quantified by the $\omega$
              ratio, to vary among both codon sites and individual branches in

              adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood (aBSREL), whose
              key innovation is variable parametric complexity chosen with an
              information theoretic criterion. By applying models of different

              lycophyte Selaginella to explore the functional ecology of
              microspore and megaspore size, traits that would be correlated
              with many aspects of a species' regeneration niche. We
              characterized habitats at a global scale using leaf area index
              (LAI), a measure of foliage density and thus shading, and net
              primary productivity (NPP), a measure of growth potential.
              Microspore size tends to decrease as habitat LAI and NPP
              increase, a trend that could be related to desiccation resistance
              or to filtration of wind-borne particles by leaf surfaces.
              Megaspore size tends to increase among species that inhabit
              regions of high LAI, but there is an important interaction with

               size diversity in ferns have shown that they have a distinctive
               genome profile compared with other land plants. Ferns are
               typically characterized by possessing medium-sized genomes,
               although a few lineages have evolved very large genomes. Ferns
               are different from other vascular plant lineages as they are the
               only group to show evidence for a correlation between genome
               size and chromosome number. In this study, we aim to explore
               whether the evolution of fern genome sizes is not only shaped by
               chromosome number changes arising from polyploidy but also by
               constraints on the average amount of DNA per chromosome. We
               selected the genus Asplenium L. as a model genus to study the
               question because of the unique combination of a highly conserved
               base chromosome number and a high frequency of polyploidy. New
               genome size data for Asplenium taxa were combined with existing
               data and analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. Genome size
               varied substantially between diploid species, resulting in
               overlapping genome sizes among diploid and tetraploid

               diploids varied non-randomly and we found evidence for

               phylogenetic framework to explore three hypotheses: the
               correlation of genome size and chromosome number, the origin of
               modern ferns from ancestors with high chromosome numbers, and
               the occurrence of several whole-genome duplications during the
               evolution of ferns. To achieve this, we generated new genome
               size data, increasing the percentage of fern species with genome
               sizes estimated to 2.8\% of extant diversity, and ensuring a
               comprehensive phylogenetic coverage including at least three
               species from each fern order. Genome size was correlated with

  abstract = "In Drosophila, homeotic mutations lead to the transformation of
              structures of one body segment into the corresponding structures
              of another segment. These mutations identify master regulator
              genes which specify segmental identity along the antero-posterior
              body axis. Dominant gain and recessive loss-of-function mutations
              generate to opposite segmental transformations. The cloning of
              the homeotic Antennapedia (Antp) gene led to the discovery of the
              homeobox, a 180-bp DNA segment characteristic for homeotic genes.
              It encodes the DNA-binding domain of the respective proteins
              which was designated as the homeodomain. Homeodomain proteins are
              transcriptional regulators which specify the body plan by
              controlling the transcription of their subordinate target genes.
              By inserting the Antp cDNA into a heat-inducible expression
              vector, the body plan can be altered in a predictable way. Using
              the homeobox as a probe, homologous Hox genes from vertebrates
              have been cloned. In the mouse, dominant gain and recessive
              loss-of-function mutations result in segmental transformations of
              opposite direction, as in Drosophila. Also, the mouse Hox genes
              can partially substitute the homologous Drosophila genes in
              transgenic flies. Therefore, the genetic control of the body plan
              is much more universal than anticipated. The three-dimensional
              structure of the Antp homeodomain and its complex with a
              consensus DNA-binding site was determined by nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The homeodomain essentially
              consists of four alpha-helices, a helix-turn-helix motif, and a
              flexible N-terminal arm. Base-specific contacts are made by both
              the recognition helix and the N-terminal arm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

              10,000 species, yet the generation of genomic resources for the
              group has lagged behind other major clades of plants.
              Transcriptomic data have proven to be a powerful tool to assess
              phylogenetic relationships, using thousands of markers that are
              largely conserved across the genome, and without the need to
              sequence entire genomes. We assembled the largest nuclear
              phylogenetic dataset for ferns to date, including 2884
              single-copy nuclear loci from 247 transcriptomes (242 ferns, five
              outgroups), and investigated phylogenetic relationships across
              the fern tree, the placement of whole genome duplications (WGDs),
              and gene retention patterns following WGDs. We generated a
              well-supported phylogeny of ferns and identified several regions
              of the fern phylogeny that demonstrate high levels of gene
              tree-species tree conflict, which largely correspond to areas of
              the phylogeny that have been difficult to resolve. Using a
              combination of approaches, we identified 27 WGDs across the
              phylogeny, including 18 large-scale events (involving more than
              one sampled taxon) and nine small-scale events (involving only
              one sampled taxon). Most inferred WGDs occur within single
              lineages (e.g., orders, families) rather than on the backbone of
              the phylogeny, although two inferred events are shared by

              (excluding Lindsaeineae and Saccolomatineae), clades which

              how retained duplicates following WGDs compared across
              independent events and found that functions of retained genes
              were largely convergent, with processes involved in binding,
              responses to stimuli, and certain organelles over-represented in
              paralogs while processes involved in transport, organelles

  title     = "Heterospory: The most iterative key innovation in the
               evolutionary history of the plant kingdom",
  author    = "Bateman, Richard M and DiMichele, William A",
  abstract  = "Summary 1 In aggregate, past discussions of heterospory and its
               role in the alternation of generations are riddled with
               ambiguities that reflect overlap of terms and concepts.
               Heterospory sensu lato can be analyzed more effectively if it is
               fragmented into a series of more readily defined evolutionary
               innovations: heterospory sensu stricto (bimodality of spore
               size), dioicy, heterosporangy, endospory, monomegaspory,
               endomegasporangy, integumentation, lagenostomy, in situ
               pollination, in situ fertilization, pollen tube formation, and
               siphonogamy (Tables 1, 2, Figs 1, 13). Current evidence suggests
               that the last five characters are confined to the seed-plants. 2
               The fossil record documents repeated evolution of heterosporous
               lineages from anisomorphic homosporous ancestors. However,
               interpretation is hindered by disarticulation of fossil
               sporophytes, the difficulty of relating conspecific but
               physically independent sporophyte and gametophyte generations in
               free-sporing pteridophytes, the inability to directly observe
               ontogeny, and the rarity of preservation of transient and/or
               microscopic reproductive phenomena such as syngamy and
               siphonogamy. Unfortunately, the rarely preserved phenomena are
               often of far greater biological significance than corresponding
               readily preserved phenomena (e.g. heterospory versus dioicy,
               heterosporangy versus endospory). 3 In most fossils gametophyte
               gender can only be inferred by extrapolation from the morphology
               of the sporophyte and especially of the spores. This is readily
               achieved for species possessing high-level heterospory, when the
               two spore genders have diverged greatly in size, morphology,
               ultrastructure and developmental behaviour. However, the
               earliest stages in the evolution of heterospory, which are most
               likely to be elucidated in the early fossil record of
               land-plants, also show least sporogenetic divergence. It is
               particularly difficult to distinguish large microspores and
               small megaspores from the large isospores of some
               contemporaneous homosporous species (Figs 3?6 a, g). Heterospory
               is best identified in fossils by quantitative analysis of
               intrasporangial spore populations. 4 The spatial scale of the
               differential expression of megaspores and microspores varies
               from co-occurrence in a single sporangium (anisospory) to
               different sporophytes (dioecy) (Figs 6?8). Studies of the
               relative positions of the two spore morphs on the sporophyte,
               and of developmentally anomalous terata (Fig. 9), demonstrate
               that gender is expressed epigenetically in both the sporophyte
               and gametophyte. Hormonal control operates via nutrient clines,
               with nutrient-rich microenvironments favouring femaleness;
               megaspores and microspores compete for sporophytic resources.
               External environments can also influence gender, particularly in
               free-living exosporic gametophytes. 5 The evolution of
               heterospory was highly iterative. The number of origins is best
               assessed via cladograms, but no current phylogeny includes
               sufficient relevant tracheophyte species. Also, several extant
               heterosporous species differ greatly from their closest
               relatives due to high degrees of ecological specialization
               and/or saltational evolution; extensive molecular data will be
               needed to ascertain their correct phylogenetic position. Current
               evidence suggests a minimum of 11 origins of heterospory, in the
               Zosterophyllopsida (1: Upper Devonian), Lycopsida (1: Upper
               Devonian), Sphenopsida (?2: Lower Carboniferous), Pteropsida
               (?4: Upper Cretaceous/Palaeogene) and Progymnospermopsida (?3:
               Upper Devonian/Carboniferous). The arguably monophyletic
               Gymnospermopsida probably inherited heterospory from their
               progymnospermopsid ancestor (Table 3, Figs 11?13). No origin of
               heterospory coincides with the origin of (and thus delimits) any
               taxonomic class of tracheophytes. The actual number of origins
               of heterospory is probably appreciably higher, exceeding that of
               any other key evolutionary innovation in land-plants and
               offering an unusually good opportunity to infer evolutionary
               process from pattern. 6 Heterospory reflects the convergent
               attainment of similar modes of reproduction in phylogenetically
               disparate lineages. Nature repeated this experiment many times,
               whereas true phylogenetic synapomorphies evolve only once and
               require a unique causal explanation. Cladograms also offer the
               best means of determining the sequence of acquisition of
               heterosporic phenomena within lineages, here exemplified using
               the lycopsids (Fig. 10). Comparison of such sequences among
               lineages can potentially allow generalizations about underlying
               evolutionary mechanisms. Current evidence (albeit inadequate)
               indicates broadly similar sequences of character acquisitions in
               all lineages, though they differ in detail. Some logical
               evolutionarily stages were temporarily bypassed. Other lineages
               appear to have acquired two or more characters during a single
               saltational evolutionary event. Heterosporic phenomena can also
               be lost during evolution. Although no complete reversals to
               homospory have been documented, this could reflect unbreakable
               developmental canalization of heterospory rather than selective
               advantage relative to homospory. Several extant species refute
               widely held assumptions that certain phenomena, notably
               heterospory and dioicy, are reliably positively correlated.
               Moreover, some fossils are likely to possess combinations of
               heterosporic characters that are not found in their extant
               descendants. Fossil data have played a crucial role in
               understanding both the number of origins of heterospory and the
               ensuing patterns of character acquisition. 7 Although
               non-adaptive evolutionary events are likely in at least some
               lineages, the highly iterative nature of heterospory and similar
               patterns of character acquisition in different lineages together
               suggest that its evolution was largely adaptively driven.
               However, many previous adaptive models of heterosporic evolution
               confused pattern and process, and paid insufficient attention to
               the role of the environment as a passive filter of novel
               morphotypes. Linear gradualistic models were imposed on the
               data, often intercalating hypothetical intermediates where
               desired. 8 The evolution of heterospory is best understood in
               terms of inherent antagonism between the sporophytic and
               gametophytic phases of the life history for control of sex ratio
               and reproductive timing. Control is achieved directly by the
               gametophyte, via gametogenesis, and indirectly by the
               sporophyte, via sporogenesis and the ability to determine to
               varying degrees the environment in which the gametophyte
               undergoes sexual reproduction. Increasing levels of heterospory
               (particularly the acquisition of endospory) compress the
               heteromorphic life history, as the increasingly dominant
               sporophyte progressively co-opts the sex determination role of
               the gametophyte. The resulting life history is more holistic,
               effectively streamlining evolution by offering only a single
               target for selection. 9 However, by wresting control of sex
               ratios from the gametophyte, the ability of the sporophyte to
               respond rapidly to environmental changes decreases. This
               competitive weakness is greatest for heterosporous species
               possessing exosporic but obligately unisexual gametophytes
               (epitomized by the pteropsid Platyzoma*). It can be alleviated
               in endosporic species by occupying favourable environments (e.g.
               the aquatic Salviniales and Marsileales), switching to an
               apomictic mode of reproduction (thereby incurring inbreeding
               depression; e.g. many selaginellaleans), or acquiring more
               complex pollination biologies (thereby by-passing the
               environment as a selective filter: the seed-plants). 10 Lineages
               differ greatly in the maximum number of heterosporic characters
               that were acquired by their most derived constituent species.
               Several Devono-Carboniferous lineages reached the level of
               reducing numbers of functional megaspores to one per sporangium
               (Figs 7 e, f, 8, 13), but only the putatively monophyletic
               gymnospermopsids broke through this apparent barrier to acquire
               the increasingly complex pollination biology that characterizes
               modern seed-plants. 11 Many theories have been proposed to
               explain the remarkable success (both in terms of species
               diversity and ecological dominance) of seed-plants. The majority
               focus on characters that are absent from the earliest
               seed-plants (the Devono-Carboniferous lyginopterid
               pteridospermaleans), which were no more reproductively
               sophisticated than other penecontemporaneous lineages possessing
               advanced heterospory (particularly the most derived lycopsids,
               equisetaleans and progymnospermopsids). Reliable pollination was
               a key reproductive breakthrough, though the sophisticated
               economic-vegetative characters inherited by the earliest
               seed-plants from their putative progymnospermopsid ancestors
               were probably equally important in ensuring their success in
               water-limited habitats. 12 With the exception of some
               ecologically specialized pteropsids, known heterosporous
               lineages originated during a relatively short period in the
               Upper Devonian and Carboniferous (Fig. 11). They exploited a
               window of opportunity that existed before niches became too
               finely partitioned and saturated with seed-plant species. This
               non-uniformitarian ecology renders negligible the probability of
               new heterosporous lineages becoming established today, even
               though ?hopeful monsters? possessing ?incipient heterospory? are
               probably constantly being generated from homosporous parents.",

               that most species have smaller genomes than expected given the
               incidence of polyploidy in their ancestries, suggesting
               selection for genome downsizing. However, comparing ancestral GS
               with the incidence of ancestral polyploidy suggests that the
               rate of DNA loss following polyploidy is likely to have been
               very low (4-70 Mb/million years, 4-482 bp/generation). This
               poses a problem. How might such small DNA losses be visible to
               selection, overcome the power of genetic drift and drive genome
               downsizing? Here we explore that problem, focussing on the role
               that double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways (non-homologous
               end joining and homologous recombination) may have played. We
               also explore two hypotheses that could explain how selection
               might favour genome downsizing following polyploidy: to reduce
               (i) nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) costs associated with nucleic
               acid synthesis in the nucleus and the transcriptome and (ii) the
               impact of scaling effects of GS on cell size, which influences
               CO2 uptake and water loss. We explore the hypothesis that losses
               of DNA must be fastest in early polyploid generations.
               Alternatively, if DNA loss is a more continuous process over
               evolutionary time, then we propose it is a byproduct of
               selection elsewhere, such as limiting the damaging activity of
               repetitive DNA. If so, then the impact of GS on photosynthesis,
               water use efficiency and/or nutrient costs at the nucleus level
               may be emergent properties, which have advantages, but not ones
               that could have been selected for over generational timescales.",

              linked to high rates of photosynthesis in angiosperms. A close
              geometric link between veins and stomata in angiosperms ensures
              that investment in enhanced venous water transport provides the
              strongest net carbon return to the plant. This link is
              underpinned by ``passive dilution'' via expansion of surrounding
              cells. However, it is not known whether this 'passive dilution'
              mechanism is present in plant lineages other than angiosperms and
              is another key feature of the angiosperms' evolutionary success.
              Consequently, we sought to determine whether the 'passive
              dilution' mechanism is; (i) exclusive to the angiosperms, (ii) a
              conserved mechanism that evolved in the common ancestor of ferns
              and angiosperms, or (iii) has evolved continuously over time. To
              do this we first we assessed the plasticity of vein and stomatal
              density and epidermal cell size in ferns in response to light
              environment. We then compared the relationships between these
              traits found among ferns with modelled relationships that assume
              vein and stomatal density respond passively to epidermal cell
              expansion, and with those previously observed in angiosperms.
              Vein density, stomatal density and epidermal cell size were
              linked in ferns with remarkably similar relationships to those
              observed in angiosperms, except that fern leaves had fewer veins
              per stomata. However, plasticity was limited in ferns and
              stomatal spacing was dependent on active stomatal differentiation
              as well as passive cell expansion. Thus, ferns (like angiosperms)
              appear to coordinate vein and stomatal density with epidermal
              cell expansion to some extent to maintain a constant ratio
              between veins and stomata in the leaf. The different general
              relationships between vein density and stomatal density in ferns
              and angiosperms suggests the groups have different optimum
              balances between the production of vein tissue dedicated to water
              supply and stomatal tissue for gas exchange.",

              exploration of fern and lycophyte genetics. First, during the
              1930s, Andersson-Kott{\"o} conducted crossing studies on ferns.
              The publication of Manton's magnum opus on fern chromosomes in
              1950 stimulated the second. The third emerged from Klekowski's
              1973 American Journal of Botany publication that posed hypotheses
              linking breeding system dynamics and polyploid genetic
              architecture. Although Klekowski's assertions (predominant
              inbreeding and active polyploid genomes) were not supported, his
              hypotheses served as the impetus for improving our knowledge of
              the evolutionary mechanisms of ferns and lycophytes. It is now
              understood that (1) homosporous vascular plants are genetically
              diploid at high chromosome numbers and (2) both heterosporous and
              homosporous plants store and release genetic variation through a
              similar range of breeding systems. However, the seeming paradox
              of diploid genetic expression in homosporous vascular plants with
              high chromosome numbers remains unresolved. Ongoing and future
              research should include (1) more studies of gametophyte biology
              to elucidate the range and frequency of different breeding
              systems; (2) genomic analyses and new research on the mechanisms
              controlling bivalent formation to help discover how and why
              homosporous plant chromosomes appear so structurally stable; (3)
              considering whether the frequency of allopolyploidy in lineages
              can help explain why some are highly polyploid; and (4)
              chromosome painting studies to identify the dynamics of
              chromosome behavior in homosporous vascular plants. These open

@ARTICLE{Petersen2017-zd,
  title    = "Why did heterospory evolve?",
  author   = "Petersen, Kurt B and Burd, Martin",
  abstract = "The primitive land plant life cycle featured the production of
              spores of unimodal size, a condition called homospory. The
              evolution of bimodal size distributions with small male spores
              and large female spores, known as heterospory, was an innovation
              that occurred repeatedly in the history of land plants. The
              importance of desiccation-resistant spores for colonization of
              the land is well known, but the adaptive value of heterospory has
              never been well established. It was an addition to a sexual life
              cycle that already involved male and female gametes. Its role as
              a precursor to the evolution of seeds has received much
              attention, but this is an evolutionary consequence of heterospory
              that cannot explain the transition from homospory to heterospory
              (and the lack of evolutionary reversal from heterospory to
              homospory). Enforced outcrossing of gametophytes has often been
              mentioned in connection to heterospory, but we review the
              shortcomings of this argument as an explanation of the selective
              advantage of heterospory. Few alternative arguments concerning
              the selective forces favouring heterospory have been proposed, a
              paucity of attention that is surprising given the importance of
              this innovation in land plant evolution. In this review we
              highlight two ideas that may lead us to a better understanding of
              why heterospory evolved. First, models of optimal resource
              allocation - an approach that has been used for decades in
              evolutionary ecology to help understand parental investment and
              other life-history patterns - suggest that an evolutionary
              increase in spore size could reach a threshold at which small
              spores yielding small, sperm-producing gametophytes would return
              greater fitness per unit of resource investment than would large
              spores and bisexual gametophytes. With the advent of such
              microspores, megaspores would evolve under frequency-dependent
              selection. This argument can account for the appearance of
              heterospory in the Devonian, when increasingly tall and complex
              vegetative communities presented competitive conditions that made
              large spore size advantageous. Second, heterospory is analogous
              in many ways to anisogamy. Indeed, heterospory is a kind of
              re-invention of anisogamy within the context of a
              sporophyte-dominant land plant life cycle. The evolution of
              anisogamy has been the subject of important theoretical and
              empirical investigation. Recent work in this area suggests that
              mate-encounter dynamics set up selective forces that can drive
              the evolution of anisogamy. We suggest that similar dispersal and
              mating dynamics could have underlain spore size differentiation.
              The two approaches offer predictions that are consistent with
              currently available data but could be tested far more thoroughly.
              We hope to re-establish attention on this neglected aspect of
              plant evolutionary biology and suggest some paths for empirical
              investigation.",

  abstract = "Homosporous ferns have usually been considered highly polyploid
              because they have high chromosome numbers (average n = 57.05). In
              angiosperms, species with chromosome numbers higher than n = 14
              generally have more isozymes than those with lower numbers,
              consistent with their polyploidy. By extrapolation, homosporous
              ferns would be expected to have many isozymes. However, ongoing
              surveys indicate that within fern genera, species having the
              lowest chromosome numbers have the number of isozymes considered
              typical of diploid seed plants. Only species above these lowest
              numbers have additional isozymes. Therefore, homosporous ferns
              either have gone through repeated cycles of polyploidy and gene
              silencing or were initiated with relatively high chromosome
              numbers. The latter possibility represents a radical departure
              from currently advocated hypotheses of fern evolution and
              suggests that there may be fundamental differences between the
              genomes of homosporous ferns and those of higher plants. These
              hypotheses can be tested by genetic, karyological, and molecular

              elements can enhance their transmission through a process known
              as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by
              preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This
              implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but
              the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are
              unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex
              regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry
              and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry.
              Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes,
              which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell
              division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry
