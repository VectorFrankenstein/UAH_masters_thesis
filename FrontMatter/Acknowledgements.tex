I would like to thank Dr. Paul Wolf (University of Alabama in Huntsville), Dr. Alex Harkess (Auburn University), Dr. Jerome Baudry (University of Alabama in Huntsville) and Dr. Norman Wickett (Clemson University) for guiding me throughout the research that has shaped up to be this thesis.

I am grateful to my advisors for providing an academic environment which was challenging and novel to me while he was easy to approach for help throughout.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to NSF grant DEB 1911459, which provided the funds for this project.

I would also like to thank the Alabama Supercomputing Authority (ASC) for generously providing the computer environment we needed to see this research completed. I would especially like to thank Dr. David Young at the ASC for being completely helpful throughout this process.

I am also thankful to the maintainers of sophisticated, peer-reviewed, free and open source software libraries/packages that made this project at all possible. The software packages used in this project have more than 2 decades of cutting-edge research behind them and it is a near miracle that software this advanced it freely available to researchers.
